<h1>Chris Bozovich</h1>
<p><strong>Veteran | Cybersecurity Professional | Cybersecurity Support Specialist</strong></p>

<p>I am transitioning from a 21-year career in the U.S. Army into the field of cybersecurity. During my military service, I served as a Military Working Dog Handler and Program Manager, overseeing operations across South and Central America and completing four combat deployments. I hold a Secret security clearance and bring discipline, leadership, and mission-focused problem solving to the cybersecurity domain.</p>

<p>I’ve earned certifications including Security+, Certified in Cybersecurity (ISC²), Google Cybersecurity, Google Cloud Security, and Microsoft IT Support Specialist, and I’m currently an IT Support Intern with an emphasis on security.</p>

<h2>Projects & Labs</h2>
<ul class="projects">
  <li><strong>Home Lab:</strong> Deploy Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi with Docker, HTTPS admin interface, and custom blocklists.</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Deployed a Flask web application securely on an AWS EC2 instance. The app runs behind an Niginx reverse proxy with Gunicorn as the application server, managed by systemd for reliability. Cloud security best practices were applied, including least-privilege IAM, restricted Security Groups, and removal of secerts form version control.</li>
  <li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> Coming Soon!.</li>
</ul>
